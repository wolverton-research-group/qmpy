# Security Policy

## Support for Vulnerability Fixes

Due to the very limited availability of resources from our side, we're currently able to 
provide only annual updates, and only on the master branch. The pip pckages are updated less
frequently. 
The dependent packages are recommended to be installed from `requirements.txt` than from
`requirements-pinned.txt` whenever possible to get the latest patched versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

A vulnerability can be reported either via Github Discussions or as an Issue. Please make sure 
to add appropriate tags, if applicable, and any suggestions on how to fix this vulenrability
would also be highly appreciated.
We would act on the problem as soon as possible, based on its severity.
