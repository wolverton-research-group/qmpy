<h1> OQMD API </h1>
<p>
OQMD now supports REpresentational State Transfer (REST) API based, fully open data 
transfer from our servers to the users around the world. 

The RESTful system allows a user to access the OQMD.org to search, filter and 
download data without having to download the entire SQL database or even without 
using a browser or any additional software packages at the user-end.

All it needs is a simple, general file retrieval system (eg: wget) and all the data 
filter constraints are passed from the user to the server via the URL of file request.

At this time, we support a native OQMD RESTful specification based on conventional qmpy data keywords, 
and the <a href="http://www.optimade.org/">OPTiMaDe</a> RESTful specification. Detailed descriptions of 
all these are provided in <a href="{% static "docs/restful.html" %}"> RESTful Documentation page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The data is availed without requiring any user credentials. 
So usage of a specific Python query package is optional, but nevertheless a standalone 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/qmpy-rester/">Querying System</a> is provided for 
convenience of the frequent users.
</p>

<h2> Implemented RESTful APIs  </h2>

<p>
A page dedicate to the details of OPTiMaDe implementation in OQMD is available <a href="/optimade">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following links are the endpoints for the user's preferred RESTful query specification. By default, these endpoints list the paginated OQMD data without applying any filters.
<ul>
	<li><a href="/oqmdapi/formationenergy">All data - OQMD API Endpoint</a></li>
	<li><a href="/optimade/structures">All data - Optimade API Endpoint</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> Documentation  </h2>
More information on the RESTful API system is available within the OQMD documention
